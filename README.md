## Hi there 👋
I'm Thelma, A second-year computer science student at DCU, Dublin. 
<!--
**Thelmina4/Thelmina4** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a website for my fellow students in COMSCI2. It contains all our deadlines, homework & project details & any pertinent module information. It is still in its infant stage. The information is there, but the beauty is still to be added. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C, R, & how to use GitHub & Gitlab. I hope to add a few webpages in here. I will also be adding my completed scripts.

- My Favourite part about computer science is all the problem-solving. Give me a puzzle & I'm happy for hours.
  
- You can reach me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/thelma-clarke-42913092/ 

Here's hoping that it all goes well.
