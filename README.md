## Hi there 👋
I'm Thelma, a second-year computer science student at DCU, Dublin.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...-->

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C, R, & how to use GitHub & Gitlab. I hope to add a few webpages in here, too. I will be adding my completed scripts, too.

- My Favourite part about computer science is all the problem-solving. Give me a puzzle & I'm happy for hours.

Here's hoping that it all goes well.
